# Galaxy

Galaxy is a sleek proxy designed to bypass internet censorship, utilizing the UV proxy and a TOMP HTTP server. Our platform even features about:blank cloaking! We offer a diverse selection of games, including Vex 5, Vex 7, Dino-game, and Basketball Stars. Additionally, we provide access to popular apps such as Discord.
